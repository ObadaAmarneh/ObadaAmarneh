# Hi, welcome to my GitHub! <img width="30" src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1593555389/9579/blob_excited.gif?1593555389" alt="party blob" />

<p>I'm a cloud solution architect focused on data and AI at <strong><a href="https://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a></strong>. 

I've been working with technology since 2012, and during this time I worked with the most diverse types of projects like: gamming programming, web programming, network management systems, business Intelligence and big data (data engineering and architecture). 

What has enchanted me the most is working with data projects seen that today we have a huge amount of data everywhere and by using the right technologies, we can get answers to solve big problems, impacting all society and making the world a better place.

Take a look in some data projects which have already been making the world a better place: <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-good">AI for Good</a></strong>.
